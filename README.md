`{fotmob}` allows users to retrieve data from the unofficial API of [fotmob](www.fotmob.com). I don't have plans to actively maintain this package.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `{foobar}` with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("tonyelhabr/foobar")
```

The functions in this package used to be in [`{worldfootballR}`](https://github.com/JaseZiv/worldfootballR). Sadly, they were removed with [this PR](https://github.com/JaseZiv/worldfootballR/pull/311) and now reside here for those wishing to use the lastest version of `{worldfootballR}` and maintain backwards compatibility with code that relies on the foobar functions.
